# Relay observability

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

The hosted relay Worker exports traces to Axiom. App-side exports are disabled in this build,
including mobile and first-party relay clients. The relay Alchemy stack still provisions:

- `t3-code-relay-traces-prod`, the Worker's OpenTelemetry trace dataset
- `t3-code-relay-otel-ingest-prod`, the dataset-scoped Worker ingest token
- `t3-code-mobile-otel-ingest-prod`, the dataset-scoped mobile ingest token
- `t3-code-relay-client-otel-ingest-prod`, the dataset-scoped first-party relay-client ingest token
- `t3-code-relay-recent-spans-prod`, a view of recent request and endpoint spans

Alchemy stages append their sanitized stage name to isolate resources, for example
`t3-code-relay-traces-dev-julius` for a personal stage.

Deploy from `infra/relay` with the normal Alchemy workflow:

```sh
vp run deploy
```

Alchemy resolves account-level Axiom deployment credentials through its provider. At runtime, the
Worker receives only its scoped ingest token. The separately provisioned mobile and relay-client
tokens are unused by this build.

The Worker emits Effect's built-in HTTP server spans plus endpoint and database child spans.
Effect's OpenTelemetry exporter stores semantic HTTP attributes below the `attributes.` prefix.
For example:

```apl
['t3-code-relay-traces-prod']
| where name startswith 'http.server'
| extend endpoint = column_ifexists('attributes.http.route', ''),
    customAttributes = column_ifexists('attributes.custom', dynamic({}))
| project _time, name, trace_id, duration,
    ['attributes.http.request.method'],
    ['attributes.url.path'],
    ['attributes.http.response.status_code'],
    endpoint,
    relayOperation = customAttributes['relay']['operation']
| order by _time desc
| limit 200
```

The provisioned view also reads the endpoint from `attributes.http.route`. Relay-specific span
annotations are stored under `attributes.custom`; `relay.operation` is one of the emitted custom
attributes.

Agents should prefer the provisioned view or APL queries for completed incidents instead of
tailing the Cloudflare Worker. The stack does not provision a separate query token. Responders who
need scripted query access use the authorized account-level `AXIOM_TOKEN` together with
`AXIOM_ORG_ID`; scoped ingest tokens remain write-only credentials for their producers.

DPoP proof failures include the stable `relay.dpop.failure_code` span attribute. A `time_window`
failure means that a signed proof was too old or too far in the future for the relay's allowed
window. It can point to a date or time problem on either device, but it can also result from a
delayed request. The client uses this category, and the absence of a category from an older relay,
to decide whether clock skew is confirmed or only one possible cause.
